###### Missed Session 1
Hi my name is Hyeon Kim, and I missed the linked session 1. However, I heard
that I should write about my experiences that I had on last Thursday, so I would
like to do so.

I went Indonesia to experience total solar eclipse last week and at the last
Thursday I was on the returning flight. I have been on various flights but such
uncrowded flight was actually the first time for me. The flight had almost no
passenger so that almost everyone in that flight could use 4 adjacent seats at
once as a bed. So I could return to Korea with a very nice sleep.

When I landed to 인천 airport it was 9:20 AM so I counldn't help attending
class. I arrived SNU at 12:00 PM and eventually I missed all classes in this
week, but it was valuable experience enough. If you want to heard about the
total eclipse, let's meet at next linked session.

- Quite amazing that each of you didn't have enough time, hope you enjoyed
  though. And it's interesting that three of your team member can speak
  Japanese. Hope to know how polular the japanese in among American society.
- Quite amazing that they do not choose their major before entering university.
  I wonder if all universities of America use such policy. And also it's so
  amazing that more than one people in your team can use and understant sign
  language. I didn't even know that I can be internationally used.

###### Linked Session
Actually I missed the linked session of the last week, so it was the first time
for me. At first I had some problem with ice breaking but my partners lead our
conversation very fluently, so I could participate easily.

We talked about the personal experince of various type of families. I heard that
most gay couple in America don't need to hide their own status. And and it made
me a bit sad because the almost every gay couple that I personally know forced
to hides their cohabitation due to social awareness. I wished that Korea to be
changed in good direction like them.
