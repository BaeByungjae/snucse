Differences of Company Culture between Korea and America
--------

Have you ever imagined how culturally different two companies can be, even when they virtually do the same job, make a same line of products, and run business in the same market?
Can you believe if Samsung and Apple, both being IT giants with competing products, have completely different atmospheres?
Company culture is certainly affected by various factors, but it seems that even in the age of globalization, the factor of nationality still plays a significant role.
Although it has been over three centuries since the inception of capitalism, each nation still exhibits radically different ways of working, too different to properly group all of them under a single term.
Let’s see how different the company culture between two countries can be by comparing the process of getting hired, spending everyday life, and resigning (or getting dismissed).

Cultural differences between Korean companies and American ones are so huge that you can realize it immediately even at the point of application.
The first notable divergence is the written self-introduction.
It is very common for Koreans to write a long essay to introduce themselves and explain why they should be hired.
Korean companies seek to learn the passion, aspiration, and personality of each applicant through these long writings.
In contrast, most American HR managers would simply check if the applicant meets the qualification for the position.
Thus, instead of a long essay, a cover letter less than one page suffices, with a list of qualifications and a set of contact informations.
The second surprise lies in the résumé.
In America, companies receive freely formatted résumés as all applicants would make their own résumé in whatever form they believe is the most effective.
However, in Korea, job hunters have to rewrite the résumé every time they apply for a new workplace, just in order to fit in their designated form.
Korean conglomerates have their own form of résumé to handle a lot of applicants’ résumé efficiently, and such company culture affected the other Korean companies to make each company’s own résumé form.
The most disturbing disparity would be the request of personal information.
In America, asking applicants of sensitive privacy questions such as birthday, family information or military records is legally prohibited.
Unless the job position requires physical appearance professionally, such as for models and actors, corporations may face a discrimination suit for asking photographs in the application.
Meanwhile in Korea, however, companies can literally ask whatever they want because nothing is illegal.
Photographs are mandatory to apply for nearly all employers, and no one raises a question for it.
Some conservative companies like Hyundai or LG even ask the job and age of the applicant’s each family member.
This is a sad aspect of the authoritarian Korean company culture.

The culture gap grows to the peak size at the aspect of the employees' daily lives.
Korean workers are supposed to call coworkers with their formal position title, to respect the hierarchy highly valued by the companies.
This is the opposite of the American way, where calling colleagues by their name is taken for granted, that sometimes people would not remember the official title of one another.
Meetings also serve as a good example.
Most American firms schedule the meeting in advance by email and try to keep meetings short whenever possible.
This is a sharp contrast with what is seen in the research paper “Diagnosis on the organizational health and corporate culture of Korean companies”, (Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry, McKinsey & Company, 2016) which describes Korean corporate meetings as long and tedious, since they are not properly scheduled beforehand and attendants remain oblivious to the agenda, let alone a chance to prepare for it.
In addition, since most Korean staff members are not allowed to dispute their senior’s decision, meetings can't function as a brainstorming occasion, limited to a report session.
The concept of vacation in two nations is also largely unlike each other.
Superficially they should be the same, but the actual practice of using vacations fundamentally differ.
Korean managers demand _reasons_ for vacations, leaving workers no choice but to somehow disclose their privacy, just for exercising their rights.
This results in workers having bigger vacations at once, to avoid making up a proper excuse every time they take a day off.
America suffers a lack of no such nonsense; taking a day off or even a semi-day off is commonplace.
Assigning a higher priority to family over work is usual for Americans, and such decision is respected.
A unique trait within Korean offices, called "hoesik", pushes the issue further.
Literal translation being _gathered eating_, this so-called "dinner" is effectively compulsory, as any absent member is considered disloyal and will later be invisibly and intangibly penalized.
A typical hoesik takes place at a barbecue house or a bar, and entails multiple rounds of changing the venue and the menu. This frequently impacts the workers' personal and family lives negatively.
Hoesik also forces people to drink unwanted alcohol as a means to the Korean way of _bonding_, harming both the victim and the society.
American business organizations do have a form of group dinner, and also enjoy a year-end party at the office, but the implication is rather difficult to relate to hoesik; anyone is rarely (if at all) forced to join or drink.
For an American businessperson, respecting personal lives is such an obvious social norm that it's hard to think otherwise.
Generally, this is why a business trip to Korea is a shocking experience.

Finally there are greatly distinct acts of dismissal and resignation.
Dismissal under the Korean labour law means a complex process and strict condition, discouraging major enterprises from doing it.
Such laws were established as a result of workers' struggle, calling for a protection of the relatively weaker side.
This is far from the American convention, where the “at-will employment” rule forms the basis of all employment contracts.
(Shepherd, 2011) The rule enables dismissal to happen more often than Korea, and people react to it in a drier manner.
For Koreans, resignation is usually a sad event.
This is not only because Korean workers value loyalty and have a tendency to devote their whole life to a single company; many cases of resignation in Korea are in fact unfair dismissal in disguise.
Since it is harder to fire workers under the Korean labor law, many Korean companies circumvent it by forcing employees to resign by transferring or treating badly in the office.
The way of _forcing_ is not exactly civic; the target would be mentally stressed, given meaningless repetitive tasks unrelated to the profession, transferred to a deserted workplace, or constantly harassed.
For Americans, although resignation is not an entirely pleasant event for them either, people are not as dramatic as Koreans upon losing a job.
As a matter of fact, it could be a good opportunity to raise their own value and perhaps salary as well.
In most cases, workers resign willingly to find another position or to catch another opportunity, which explains why resignation happens more frequently.

Corporations of two countries show various differences, hinting the national differences behind them.
While Korean ones are clearly centered around the philosophy of hierarchy with an authoritarian attitude, the American counterparts are more liberal, but also less protective of the labor class.
Pros and cons may vary depending on the perspective, but we should at least admit that compared to the American style, some Korean characteristics are vividly bad; hoesik and forced resignation are remarkable examples.
Grasping these differences will decisively improve your insight in making career decisions when you have an opportunity abroad.
